## Risk Assessment for Deployment

### If We Deploy Now (NO-GO Scenario)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Required |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| Model failure with real data | HIGH | CRITICAL | Must validate with real data first |
| Security vulnerability | MEDIUM | CRITICAL | Security audit required |
| Production instability | HIGH | HIGH | Environment setup needed |
| Regulatory issues | LOW | HIGH | Compliance review needed |

**Risk Score: 78/100 (HIGH RISK)**

### If We Deploy After Prerequisites (GO Scenario)

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Minor bugs | LOW | LOW | Hotfix process ready |
| Performance issues | LOW | MEDIUM | Monitoring in place |
| User adoption | MEDIUM | LOW | Training provided |
| Market conditions | LOW | MEDIUM | Stop-loss active |

**Risk Score: 25/100 (ACCEPTABLE RISK)**

```
Day 1-2: Complete real data validation
Day 3: Security audit
Day 4: Production setup
Day 5: Final testing and deployment
Risk: LOW
Confidence: 95%
Recommendation: PROCEED
```

### Scenario 3: CONSERVATIVE Deployment
```
Week 1: Extended testing with real data
Week 2: Security and compliance review
Week 3: Phased deployment
Risk: MINIMAL
Confidence: 99%
Recommendation: If time permits
```
